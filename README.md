# AzureSearchNodeJSIndexerDemo

NodeJS program that creates an Azure Search index and automatically populates it with data from a SQL Azure instance using an indexer.

Also comes with a simple React UI to query results.

## To get started

1. git clone <https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureSearchNodeJSIndexerDemo.git>
2. `npm install`
3. `npm install -g http-server`
4. populate `config.js` with your search service URL & api key
5. `npm run indexDocuments`
6. `npm run build`
7. `npm run start_server`
8. direct your browser at <http://localhost:8080/index.html>

Step five will run a script that creates and index, datasource, and indexer. This indexer will scrape a SQL Azure DB, provided by the Azure Search team, and automatically push all rows into your Azure Search Index.
